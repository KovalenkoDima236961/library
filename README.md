The application is an interactive library in which you can view book descriptions, add books to your favorites, and vote for the best book, genre, and author. There is a mini-quiz

---------How to start the application------
For the application to work properly, you must have an internet connection (through the database).
When you start the application, you are taken to the login/registration page.For convenience, I have provided you with the admin data that is already written in the login fields.
After that, you get to the main page where you have options.
1) Go to Top Books, where you can view the 10 best books and vote for one of them.
2) Go to Browse, where you can view all books, and use the search engine to find your book.
3) Go to Categorie, where you can view books by category.
4) Quiz, this is a mini-quiz in which you choose the best one from 24 books in your opinion (the system is implemented so that you first choose 12 books, then 6 and so on )(When you have completed the quest, click on the close button)
5) Favorites - you can view all your favorite books. You can add to favorites on almost all pages
6) Voting - you can vote for the best book, author and genre.
7) Top - you can view the best book in the library, the best author (also see a chart with all the information on the number of votes), and the best genre (also added a chart).
8) And the last page at the moment is the profile, where you can change personal data and, if you are an admin, view all books (delete, add books), and view all users (and do the same)
9) History - In the history, you can view the latest books you've viewed

---------Data selection------
I use a database for users and books. I also have a serialisation implemented to load the history and download the total number of users in my library.
Also, when creating the database, I am creating a new thread to improve the performance of my application

When writing the application, for better page design, I used this video (in which a man makes the frontend):
